This directory constains wrappers for some of the RBDL functions. This is
more of a proof of concept but adding wrappers for the complete library should
be straight forward.

If anyone is interested in theses wrappers feel free to contact me or send
patches. I would be happy to assist.

You may have to modify the Makefile to adjust the *_PATH settings to be able to
compile it.

See example.m for usage and API overview.
